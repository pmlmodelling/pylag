[NUMERICS]
# The numerical method used to compute changes in particle positions. This option
# controls whether operator splitting is used to combine the contributions of
# advection and diffusion.
# standard          - The iterative method is set through the option `iterative_method'.
#                     The specified iterative method may correspond to cases of pure
#                     advection, pure diffusion or both. In the case of both advection
#                     and diffusion, operator splitting is not performed; rather, the effects
#                     of both processes are computed at the same time using the same time step
#                     and using the specified iterative method. StdNumMethod objects require no
#                     knowledge or the type of iterative method being used; they simply
#                     use it compute the change in a particle's position.
# operator_split_0  - A form of operator splitting in which the advection step is
#                     performed first followed by the diffusion step. The iterative 
#                     methods used for the advection and diffusion steps are set through
#                     the options `adv_iterative_method' and `diff_iterative_method' 
#                     respectively. The two processes can use different time steps; these
#                     are set through the parameters `time_step_adv' and `time_step_diff'
#                     respectively. `time_step_adv' must be greater than or equal to
#                     `time_step_diff' and `time_step_adv'%`time_step_diff' must equal 0.
#                     An exception will be raised if either of these conditions is not
#                     met.
# operator_split_1  - A form of operator splitting in which a half step for diffusion 
#                     is performed first followed by a full advection step followed
#                     by a half diffusion step. The iterative methods used for the advection
#                     and diffusion steps are set through the options `adv_iterative_method'
#                     and `det_iterative_method' respectively. The two processes use different

#                     `time_step_diff' respectively. `time_step_adv' must be exactly equal to
#                     2 * `time_step_diff'. An exception will be raised if this condition is not
#                     met.

# both advection and diffusion, "AdvDiff" is appended to the beginning of the name. The
# dimensionality of each scheme is implicit within the name. 1D schemes compute changes

#                          inhomgeneous diffusivity fields. Diffusivities are evaluated at a z 
#                          position offset from Z_n. The scheme converges with delta t and 
#                          sqrt(delta t) in the weak and strong sense respectively.
# Diff_Milstein_[1,2,3]D - 1-, 2- or 3-D Milstein schemes that converge with delta t in both the
#                          strong and the weak sense.
