PyLag can be fed inputs from a number of different sources, including both analytical and numerical models of
different flow fields, or direct observations (e.g. from HF Radar facilities). Inputs may be read in from disk or
calculated on the fly. Below a number of example use cases are described. These start with very simple analytical
models of different flows, the results of which are used to verify the model implementation, and to test the accuracy of
different numerical integration schemes. More involved examples include using PyLag directly with different ocean models,
and with inputs defined on common structured and unstructured grid types. Collectively, the examples highlight different
model features, such as running forward or backward in time simulations; running with Cartesian or Geographic Coordinates;
performing ensemble simulations; and exploiting PyLag's parallel computing support.
