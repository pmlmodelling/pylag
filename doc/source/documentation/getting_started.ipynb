    "# Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we provide general information on setting up and running PyLag. For specific applications - e.g., running PyLag with data generated by a given hydrodynamic model, such as FVCOM - please see [PyLag's tutorial examples](../examples/index.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "After PyLag has been [installed](../install/installation.rst), a typical workflow involves *three* steps: 1) Obtaining and/or generating the required input files; 2) Running the simulation; and 3) Analysing the results. Further details regarding these three steps are provided below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Obtaining and/or generating the set of input files required by PyLag\n",
    "\n",
    "For typical use cases, PyLag requires four types of input:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **NetCDF data files** containing input data (e.g. velocity components) required by PyLag.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **A grid metrics file**, which describes the underlying grid on which input data are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **An initial positions file**, which gives the starting coordinates of particles in Cartesian or Geographic coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **A run configuration file** in which all run parameters and paths are set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) NetCDF data files\n",
    "\n",
    "NetCDF data files containing fluid velocity components, eddy diffusivities etc are required inputs. All ocean specific variables for a given time point or set of time points should be provided in the same file. The dataset may be split into multiple files through time, with all files following a common naming convention (see below). When support for including the impact of waves and direct atmospheric forcing is included, the set of input files will be extended to include files specific to wave and astmopheric products respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the set of ocean specific variables have been generated by one of the named models supported by PyLag (e.g. ROMS, FVCOM) then the data files can be fed to PyLag as is. This will typically be the case for data obtained from other supported sources too (e.g. the CMEMS catalogue). However, some manipulation may be needed if, say, the set of ocean variables have been saved in separate files.\n",
    "\n",
    "All input files must contain a `time` variable with a [units attribute](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/), allowing times to be converted into [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) objects. The files should also contain grid information (e.g. depth, latitude and longitude arrays). Any number of input data files can be provided. With respect to file name conventions, the primary requirement is that they are named using a pattern that allows them to be sorted sequentially through time. For example, two data files for January and February 2002 could be named `file_001.nc` and `file_002.nc`. Using appropriately constructed datestrings in the file name is usually sufficient to guarentee sequential ordering. PyLag will automatically check that the simulation start and end times lie within the time range covered by the input files, and that at least one of the particles in the initial particle seed lies within the spatial grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the header for a NetCDF file downloaded from the CMEMS catalogue is given below. The file contains information from the [GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_PHY_001_031](http://marine.copernicus.eu/documents/PUM/CMEMS-GLO-PUM-001-031.pdf) product. The file contains grid information and *u* and *v* velocity components for a global reanalysis run at 1/4 degree resolution. From the global metadata, it can be seed data from multiple months has been concatenated into a single file for convenience.\n",

    "### The grid metrics file\n",
    "\n",
    "The second input requirement is a grid metrics file in NetCDF format. It is required for all runs involving 2D or 3D spatial data. Within it are a set of variables describing an unstructured triangular mesh which has been constructed from the underlying grid. In the case of FVCOM, which already employs an unstructured grid, the grid metrics file saves variables describing the same grid, but with node and neighbour elements reordered to match PyLag's requirements. For regular grids, a new unstructured grid is created from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid metrics is a requirement as it saves on having to compute the same information at the start of each run. It provides all the information PyLag needs to correctly read in and interpret the gridded input data. Special functions are provided in the module [`pylag.grid_metrics`](../api/pylag.grid_metrics.rst) which can be used to create grid metrics files that are specific to the type of input data being used. As an example, a grid metrics file for the above CMEMS data can be created so:\n",

    "```python\n",
    ">>> import pylag\n",

    "```\n",

    "Most of the variables are self explanatory, given the variable long names. Possible exceptions are the variables `trim_first_latitude` and `trim_last_latitude`. These are binary flags, which indicate whether the first and/or last latitude points should be trimmed when PyLag reads input data from file. They are included as global data products are sometimes interpolated onto a regular grid which includes a row of points lying directly over one or both poles. On a spherical Earth, all these points refer to the same location, and the row is frequently masked. To prevent problems associated with handling such points, PyLag will trim them if they exist. These flags indicate whether this has happened or not. Other variables of note are `perturbation`, gives the order of nodes in the grid. It is used to sort input arrays so that data points are correctly matched to nodes that make up the unstructured grid. Lastly, the `_c` name qualifier is used to flag variables specific to element centres (as opposed to element nodes).\n",

    "### The initial positions file\n",
    "\n",
    "*PyLag* must be given the initial positions of particles at the start of each new simulation. When running *PyLag* from the command line, particle initial positions can be specified in one of two ways. In the first approach, particle initial positions are read in from a text file with a specified format, as outlined below. In the second approach, particle initial positions are read from a restart file which has been created at the end of or during a previous simulation. The choice is specified in the run configuration file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initial position text files must have the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "n\n",

    "group_id x1 x2 x3\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The entries have the following meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **n** is the total number of particles. It must always be the first entry in the file.\n",
    "* **group_id** is an integer number that can be used to group particles. This can be useful if, say, you want to look at a group of particles that started off from a similar location. It does not affect particle dynamics. It is recorded in the simulation output files.\n",
    "* **x1** is the particle's first position coordinate. In a cartesian coordinate system, this should be *x* in meters. In a geographic coordinates, it should be the particle's longitude in degrees east.\n",
    "* **x2** is the particle's second position coordinate. In a cartesian coordinate system, this should be *y* in meters. In a geographic coordinates, it should be the particle's latitude in degrees north.\n",
    "* **x3** is the particle's third position coordinate. This is always the particle's depth, *z*, in meters. *z* can be given relative to the moving free surface or the sea floor. The choice is set in the run configuration file using the option `depth_coordinates`. Depth is positive up. Thus, if `depth_coordinates` is set to `depth_below_surface`, a depth, $z$, of -0.1 would specify a starting *z* position 0.1 m below the free surface. The model will interpolate the free surface height to the particle's position in time and space, so you don't need to worry about what the sea surface height is at a particlular point in time (unless you set a starting depth that lies below the sea floor). There is also an option to start particles off from a specified distance above the sea floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an initial positions file, `initial_positions.dat`, for a simulation involving two particles with the same group ID, whose lateral coordinates are given in degrees and initial vertical coordinates are coincident with the free surface, might look like:\n",
